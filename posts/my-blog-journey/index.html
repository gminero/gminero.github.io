<p>2 Years ago I decided to start a personal blog to write about tech subjects (mostly salesforce related), In this post, I will take you through the journey that lead to what my blog is today.</p>

<h2 id="the-beggining">The Beggining</h2>

<p>2 Years ago, I wanted to begin blogging about Salesforce subjects. I had recently discovered <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> and was already familiar with <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>. So for me it was a no brainer, Start a blog, use Django, Heroku and Voila&hellip; Create content!</p>

<p>After setting my repository, I then had a fully fegged site, a database, was using a CMS built on top of Django <a href="https://wagtail.io/">Wagtail</a> and I proceeded with creating my first blog site - I was basically checking out multiple IDE&rsquo;s and giving my 2 cents on each alongside the Pro&rsquo;s and Con&rsquo;s, however, I quickly realized that this was time consuming. Everytime I Wanted to add, create, edit content, I had to log in to the platform I had setup as an admin, edit as a draft, then publish. Another issue I ran into was storing Images, everytime I did changes to my page models, this would wipe my DB and I would lose my images&hellip;</p>

<p>After that first blog post I wrote, I simply stopped writting&hellip; additionally, other projects I was working on the side were taking most of my spare time as well as my participation on <a href="https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions">stackexchange</a>.</p>

<h2 id="1-year-later">1 Year Later</h2>

<p>I was aware that I had a blog site that was there, and I really wanted to add content, write on Aura lightning components, my personal experiences with the framework, etc etc&hellip;
But, some other things took presedence, I also started doing Speaker session at some Community Events and thought that I should probably re-work on my blog with some other framework.</p>

<p>Where I work, A colleague had told me about <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and I read about <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>, so I started thinking of changing approaches and redesigning my blog, but again, lack of time meant nothing would happen for another year&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="2-years-later">2 Years Later</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, enough is enough!</p>

<p>This had to be done, ðŸ˜… .</p>

<p>I had started experimenting with <a href="https://golang.org/">GO</a></p>

<p>and wanted to do something in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a>. Markdown gave me the flexibility of using a markup language to avoid any sort of GUI and quickly write whatever came to my mind and using <a href="https://github.com">GIT</a>, simply push whatever I did locally to a repository and whenI would be satisfied with what I saw, deploy to another repository which would actually hsot my search page.</p>

<p>As a Framework, I chose <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, which is built on top of Golang. It is a static site generator which has been around since 2013. Setting myself up took literally 20-30 minutes + getting familiar with the templating and static generator functionality. Then I had to get familair with hosting my site on Github, so that took me another 15 minutes.</p>

<p>I have to say, I am very satisfied with the result, and would definitely recommend this approach for building a static site.</p>

<p>One of the disadvantages I saw with heroku was the build time &amp;&amp; the fact taht the free Tier puts the amchien to sleep after 30 minutes of activity, but overall it is not a downer for more complex projects and testing. Heroku itself has a greater learning curve, but in the long run is definitely usefull.</p>
